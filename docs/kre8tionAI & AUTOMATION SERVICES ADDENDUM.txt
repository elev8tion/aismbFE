AI & AUTOMATION SERVICES ADDENDUM

ELEV8TION LLC

This AI & Automation Addendum (“Addendum”) is incorporated into the Master Services Agreement between ELEV8TION LLC (“ELEV8TION”) and Client.

This Addendum governs all services involving artificial intelligence systems, automations, and agent-based workflows.

⸻

1. Nature of AI Systems

Client acknowledges that artificial intelligence systems:
	•	May produce incorrect or unpredictable outputs
	•	May change behavior over time
	•	Depend on third-party model providers
	•	Require human oversight
	•	Should not be relied upon without review

AI systems are tools that assist decision-making and automation but do not replace human judgment.

⸻

2. Human Review Requirement

Client agrees that all AI outputs must be reviewed by a qualified human prior to:
	•	sending communications
	•	executing financial actions
	•	interacting with customers
	•	making operational decisions

Client assumes responsibility for reviewing outputs before reliance or use.

3. Automation & Autonomous Agents

Where systems include automated or semi-autonomous agents:

Client is responsible for:
	•	approving deployment
	•	defining permissions
	•	supervising operation
	•	monitoring outcomes
	•	disabling systems if issues arise

Once a system is approved for production use, Client assumes responsibility for all automated actions taken by that system.

ELEV8TION is not liable for:
	•	automated communications
	•	workflow actions
	•	system decisions
	•	customer interactions generated by agents

Client agrees use of such tools is subject to the provider’s terms.

⸻

7. Client Deployment Responsibility

Client is solely responsible for:
	•	deciding whether to deploy systems
	•	determining appropriate use cases
	•	ensuring compliance with applicable laws
