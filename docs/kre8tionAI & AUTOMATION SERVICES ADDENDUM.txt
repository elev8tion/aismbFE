AI & AUTOMATION SERVICES ADDENDUM

ELEV8TION LLC

This AI & Automation Addendum ("Addendum") is incorporated into the Master Services Agreement between ELEV8TION LLC ("ELEV8TION") and Client.

This Addendum governs all services involving artificial intelligence systems, automations, and agent-based workflows.

⸻

1. Nature of AI Systems

Client acknowledges that artificial intelligence systems:
	•	May produce incorrect or unpredictable outputs
	•	May change behavior over time
	•	Depend on third-party model providers
	•	Require human oversight
	•	Should not be relied upon without review

AI systems are tools that assist decision-making and automation but do not replace human judgment.

⸻

2. Human Review Requirement

Client agrees that all AI outputs must be reviewed by a qualified human prior to:
	•	sending communications
	•	executing financial actions
	•	interacting with customers
	•	making operational decisions

Client assumes responsibility for reviewing outputs before reliance or use.

⸻

3. Automation & Autonomous Agents

Where systems include automated or semi-autonomous agents:

Client is responsible for:
	•	approving deployment
	•	defining permissions
	•	supervising operation
	•	monitoring outcomes
	•	disabling systems if issues arise

Once a system is approved for production use, Client assumes responsibility for all automated actions taken by that system.

ELEV8TION is not liable for:
	•	automated communications
	•	workflow actions
	•	system decisions
	•	customer interactions generated by agents
	•	operational impacts of automation

⸻

4. Capability Transfer & Training Model

ELEV8TION provides training, architecture, and system development intended to transfer capability to Client.

Upon completion of training or delivery:

Client assumes responsibility for:
	•	operating systems
	•	maintaining systems
	•	supervising automations
	•	updating workflows

ELEV8TION offers Active Monitoring as an optional continued engagement after the minimum term. Active Monitoring is available month-to-month and includes system health checks, agent performance review, and issue response. If Client does not elect Active Monitoring, Client assumes full responsibility for ongoing system operation, maintenance, and supervision of all deployed systems.

⸻

5. No Guarantee of Accuracy or Results

Client acknowledges that AI systems:
	•	may contain errors
	•	may generate incomplete or inaccurate content
	•	may not achieve expected results

Any performance metrics, efficiency projections, or ROI examples provided by ELEV8TION are illustrative only and not guaranteed.

⸻

6. Third-Party AI Providers

AI systems may rely on third-party providers including but not limited to:
	•	model APIs
	•	software tools
	•	automation platforms

ELEV8TION is not responsible for:
	•	provider outages
	•	model changes
	•	pricing changes
	•	discontinued services
	•	provider data handling

Client agrees use of such tools is subject to the provider's terms.

Bundled Tiers: ELEV8TION manages API accounts and includes infrastructure costs within the monthly fee up to defined usage allowances. Usage above allowances is billed as overage.

Pass-Through Tier: Client holds their own API accounts. Client is solely responsible for all API costs, usage limits, and provider relationships. ELEV8TION has no liability for Client's API expenses.

⸻

6.5 Usage Allowances & Overage (Bundled Tiers Only)

For Bundled tier engagements, the monthly fee includes a usage allowance as defined in the SOW (500 or 1,500 AI interactions per month).

	•	Usage above the allowance is billed at $0.08 per interaction
	•	ELEV8TION will notify Client when usage reaches 80% of the monthly allowance
	•	At 100% usage, ELEV8TION may apply emergency rate limits to prevent unbudgeted overages
	•	Overage charges are billed on the following invoice cycle and are non-refundable

This section does not apply to Pass-Through tier engagements.

⸻

7. Client Deployment Responsibility

Client is solely responsible for:
	•	deciding whether to deploy systems
	•	determining appropriate use cases
	•	ensuring compliance with applicable laws
	•	monitoring system performance

ELEV8TION does not control how Client uses delivered systems after implementation.

⸻

8. Limitation of Liability for AI Systems

To the maximum extent permitted by law:

ELEV8TION shall not be liable for any damages arising from:
	•	reliance on AI outputs
	•	automated system actions
	•	data processed by AI systems
	•	decisions made using AI tools

All AI systems are provided "as is" without warranties of performance or accuracy.

⸻

9. Acceptance of Risk

By using AI-enabled systems developed or configured by ELEV8TION, Client acknowledges and accepts the inherent risks associated with artificial intelligence and automation technologies.

⸻

10. Survival

This Addendum survives termination of the Master Services Agreement.
